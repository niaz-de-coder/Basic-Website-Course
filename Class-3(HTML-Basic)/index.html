		<p style="color : white;">The essay on environmental pollution explains how the earth and its natural resources are under the ever-increasing threat of pollution. All life on earth is threatened by this vicious process initiated by human intervention. The pollutants released from all kinds of human activity, including industrial processes, have had devastating effects on the delicate balance of nature. The most common forms of environmental pollution are air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution. Environmental pollution has to be addressed as the most pressing problem facing humanity now, and solutions have to be implemented before it is too late. Pollution has been causing damage to natural resources in every corner of the world for decades, but it seems that we have been running away from taking any positive measures to mitigate its impact on the environment. This environmental pollution essay in English will help children realise these factors and instruct them to conserve the environment and handle natural resources with the care they deserve.</p>
